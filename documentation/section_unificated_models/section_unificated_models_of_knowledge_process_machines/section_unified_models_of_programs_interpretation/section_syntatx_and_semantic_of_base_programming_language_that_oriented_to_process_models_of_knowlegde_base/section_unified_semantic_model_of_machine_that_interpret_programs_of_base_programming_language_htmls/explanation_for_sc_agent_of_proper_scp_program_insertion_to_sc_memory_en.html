<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent_of_proper_scp_program_insertion_to_sc_memory">sc-agent of proper scp-program insertion to sc-memory</sc_element></b>
 is essentially a type of
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent">sc-agents</sc_element> integration of knowledge. This 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent">sc-agent</sc_element> performs standard 
  gluing operation on the main nodes, and performs a check for potential 
   synonymy of the <sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp_program's </sc_element>insertion
 with any of the 
  already available in the system. After immersion of the
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element> in
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_memory">sc-memory</sc_element> it falls into the set of
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "rrr">scp-programs</sc_element>which were generated.
