<p>
The task of the
<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent_of_scp_process_destruction">sc-agent of scp-process destruction"</sc_element></b> is destruction of an
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element>,that is deleting from  
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_memory">sc-memory</sc_element> of all 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_element">sc-elements</sc_element>, its components. This 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent">sc-agent</sc_element> is activated in case of appearance in
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_memory">sc-memory</sc_element> of an
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element>, belonging to the class of the
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "rrr">useless scp-processes</sc_element>.
</p>
<p> 
Thus destroyed
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element> shall be optionally completely created. Need of destruction not until the end of the created  can arise if in case of creation
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element>  can arise if in case of creation of 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element> were problems, not allowing to continue creation of  
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element> and its execution.
