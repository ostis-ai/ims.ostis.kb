Problem of the
<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent_of_scp_process_creation">sc-agent of scp-process creation</sc_element></b> is creation of the 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-processes</sc_element>, corresponding to an
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element>. This
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent">sc-agent</sc_element> activated by the appearance in the
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_memory">sc-memory</sc_element> an
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "question_initiated">question of initialization</sc_element>, belonging to the class of 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator_interpretation_request">requests of interpretation of the scp-program</sc_element>.
</p>
<p>
After chacking initiation conditions creation of  
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element> is executed by 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent">sc-agent</sc_element>from the accounting of specific parameters of interpretation
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element>, then search of an
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "rrel_init">initial operator'</sc_element>  is carried out of
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element> and its activization .
</p>
<p>
Creation of unique copies of the executed 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element> in case of each its start requires additional expenses of time and memory, however such approach has a row of essential advantages:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
creating 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element> can be reconfigured directly in progress, with no risk of damage to the original 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element>;
</li>
<li>
implementation of the created  
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element> does not require calls to the original 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element>, thus eliminating the need to synchronize access
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-processes</sc_element>,corresponding to the same 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element> as a sharing resource;
</li>
<li>
execution of created 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-processes</sc_element> can be physically implemented on different devices in parallel, which greatly increases the effect of increasing the hardware basis for additional resources;
</li>
<li>
there is no need to specify
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element>,within which some 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "rrel_scp_var">scp-variable'</sc_element> has a given
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_scp_var_value">value*</sc_element>, because each
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_var">scp-variable</sc_element>' becomes unique within
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_memory">sc-memory</sc_element> as a result of copying also can have only one  
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_scp_var_value">value*</sc_element>;
</li>
<li>
when 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_process">scp-process</sc_element> has been created
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "rrel_scp_var">scp-variables'</sc_element>, corresponding to the 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "rrel_in">in-parameters'</sc_element> of an
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element>are physically replaced with
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_element">sc-elements</sc_element>, specified as parameters in the corresponding query interpretation.Such changeover allows to exclude additional operation of search
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_scp_var_value">value*</sc_element> for the specified
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "rrel_scp_var">scp-variables'</sc_element>, as they become 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "rrel_scp_const">scp-constants'</sc_element>.
</li>
