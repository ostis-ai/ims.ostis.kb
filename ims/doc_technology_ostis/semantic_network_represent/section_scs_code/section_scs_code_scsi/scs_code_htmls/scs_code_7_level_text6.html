<p>Let's pay attention that in comparison with representation of this <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_sentence">sc.s-sentence</sc_element> in <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code_level_6">a level 6 SCs-code</sc_element> record became more laconic at the expense of combining and deleting similar fragments of <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence_6_level">sc.s-sentences of level 6</sc_element>.</p>
