<p>It is possible to abbreviated record clarifying the types of <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connectors</sc_element> for which we introduced <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_divider">sc.s-delimiters</sc_element> : and :: (<sc_element sys_idtf="scs_modifier">modifiers sc-connectors</sc_element>) in <b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence_3_level">sc.s-3 level sentences</sc_element></b>.</p>
<p>If these delimiters are found in a sentence several times, the record points that all the updates type refer to the same <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connector</sc_element>.</p>
<p>You can use refinement type of <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connectors</sc_element>, as part of non-atomic identifiers entered in the <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence_2_level">proposals</sc_element>, for example (v1 => r1 : r2: v2).</p>
