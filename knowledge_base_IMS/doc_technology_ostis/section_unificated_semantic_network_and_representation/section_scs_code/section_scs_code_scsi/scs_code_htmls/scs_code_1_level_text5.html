<p><b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence_1_level">sc.s-sentence of level 1</sc_element></b> – <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_sentence">sc.s-sentence</sc_element> including only a <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_divider_incidence">sc.s- separators   of  incidence</sc_element> and  <sc_element sys_idtf="nrel_idtf">names of  sc-elements</sc_element>.</p>
<p>Each such sentence  represents the triple,  each  of  which describes incidence of some <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connector</sc_element> and two other <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-elements</sc_element>.</p>
<p>There are  all <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-elements</sc_element> should be are called  for this. Connectors  and  files name   in accordance with the identification rules of connectors and files.</p>
<p>Use of not-atomic  identifiers , which  contain  limiters <...>, {...}, \[...\] or \[*...*\], is forbidden.</p>
<p>Thus at each described triple the middle name corresponds <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connector</sc_element> the type of that can be refined using the identification rules of the connectors and files.</p>
<p>In case the indicated <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connector</sc_element> is oriented (it is a <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_arc">sc-arm</sc_element>), the first and third element of the triple correspond  to the first and second elements of the bunch.  The bunch’s sign is the given <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connector</sc_element>.</p>
<p>I.e. the name of the <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-element</sc_element>, from which it the specified arc exits, is listed first in the top of the triple. The name of the <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-element</sc_element> which includes this arc, is indicated for third in the triple.</p>
<p>The following rules of specification of <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-elements’</sc_element> types can be used for specifying of <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-element’s</sc_element> type :</p>
<p><" <b>element’s name with type specification</b> "> ::= <" <b>type of element</b> "> # \["<"<b>name of element</b> ">"\]</p>
<p><" <b>type of element</b> "> ::= (" sc_node || sc_link || sc_arc_common || sc_edge || sc_arc_main || sc_arc_access ")</p>
<p><" <b>element’s name</b> "> - an arbitrary unique string string of characters, which is unique for the <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-elements</sc_element> of the given type. As a name it is recommended to use the system identifier of the <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-element</sc_element>. If the sign “.” is preceded to the global identifier then this name is only used to represent an element in the source texts. This name isn’t translated as the system identifier. Herewith such name must also be unique within all the source tests of the knowledge base.</p>
<p><" <b>element’s name<b> "> can be absent, but then  <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-element</sc_element>, which described as <" <b>type of element</b> "> #  will be treated as the <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-element</sc_element> of the indicated type without an identifier.</p>
<p>A <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-element</sc_element> of the indicated type is considered as a <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_node">sc-node</sc_element> by default.</p>
